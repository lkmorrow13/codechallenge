// I'm guessing that i need to write a counting function that takes the input number and counts it. and with every count adds a 1 or 0 to the string.
// So what i am thinking is that i need to create an array with 1 and 0 and have it count through that and each one it counts to the string.
 

function stringy(size) {
	this.size = ['1', '0'];
	for (var i = 0; i < this.size.length; i++) {
